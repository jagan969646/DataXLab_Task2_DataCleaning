## 🧾 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **data-driven Power BI dashboard** using the *Sample Superstore* dataset to visualize key business metrics — Sales, Profit, and Discounts — across various categories, regions, and customer segments.

The goal was to demonstrate skills in **data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling** by identifying actionable business insights through interactive visuals.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Summary
The dataset was preprocessed using **Python (Pandas)** to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization.

**Key Steps:**
1. Converted date columns (`Order Date`, `Ship Date`) to proper datetime format.  
2. Removed duplicate records based on `Order ID` and `Product ID`.  
3. Filtered invalid discount and quantity values.  
4. Standardized categorical fields (Region, Category, Sub-Category).  
5. Added a `Year-Month` field for time-series analysis.  
6. Exported the clean dataset as `Cleaned_Superstore.csv`.

**Output File:** `D:\intern\Cleaned_Superstore.csv`
